# Python - Almost a Circle

## Introduction
This Python script is designed to generate and manipulate shapes that are almost circles. It provides functionalities to create, modify, and analyze shapes that closely resemble circles.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script is compatible with Python 3.x.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/almost_a_circle.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

## Usage
To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:

## Features
- **Shape Generation**: Create almost circular shapes with specified parameters.
- **Modification**: Adjust the dimensions and properties of existing shapes.
- **Analysis**: Calculate various attributes of the generated shapes, such as area and perimeter.
- **Visualization**: Display the shapes using ASCII art or graphical libraries.

## Examples
1. Generating an Almost Circular Shape:
    ```
    Enter radius: 5
    Generating almost circular shape with radius 5...
    Shape created successfully.
    ```
2. Modifying a Shape:
    ```
    Enter new radius: 7
    Modifying shape with new radius 7...
    Shape modified successfully.
    ```
3. Analyzing a Shape:
    ```
    Analyzing shape...
    Area: 153.94
    Perimeter: 44.23
    ```
